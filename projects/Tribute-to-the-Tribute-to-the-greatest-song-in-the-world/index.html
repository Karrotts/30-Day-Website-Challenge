          <p class="lyrics-text">
          Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,<br>
          We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.<br>
          All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon.<br>
          In the middle of the road.<br>
          And he said:<br>
          "Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul." (soul)<br><br>
          Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,<br>
          And we each said. "Okay."<br><br>
          And we played the first thing that came to our heads,<br>
          Just so happened to be,<br>
          The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.<br><br>
          Look into my eyes and it's easy to see<br>
          One and one make two, two and one make three,<br>
          It was destiny.<br>
          Once every hundred-thousand years or so,<br>
          When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow<br>
          And the grass doth grow<br><br>
          Needless to say, the beast was stunned.<br>
          Whip-crack went his whoopy tail,<br>
          And the beast was done.<br>
          He asked us: "(snort) Be you angels?"<br>
          And we said, "Nay. We are but men."<br>
          Rock!<br>
          Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,<br>
          Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!<br><br>
          This is not The Greatest Song in the World, no.<br>
          This is just a tribute.<br>
          Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World, no, no.<br>
          This is a tribute, oh, to The Greatest Song in the World,<br>
          All right! It was The Greatest Song in the World,<br>
          All right! It was the best muthafuckin' song the greatest song in the world.<br><br>
          And the peculiar thing is this my friends:<br>
          The song we sang on that fateful night it didn't actually sound<br>
          Anything like this song.<br><br>
          This is just a tribute! You gotta believe it!<br>
          And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.<br>
          Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',<br>
          So surprised to find you can't stop it.<br><br>
          All right! All right!<br>

          <h1 class="about-title"> About Tenacious D </h1>
          <p class="about-text">
          Tenacious D is an American comedy rock duo that was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1994. Composed of lead vocalist and guitarist Jack Black and lead guitarist and vocalist Kyle Gass, the band has released three albums â€“ Tenacious D (2001), The Pick of Destiny (2006) and Rize of the Fenix (2012). Tenacious D's studio releases, and (as of 2006) its live performances, feature a full band lineup, including such musicians as guitarist John Konesky and bassist John Spiker. Drummer Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters, Nirvana) has played on every studio release.
          <br><br>
          The band first gained popularity in 1997 when they starred in their eponymous television series and began to support large rock acts. In 2001, they released Tenacious D, their debut album featuring a full band. The first single, "Tribute," was the band's most successful achieving their only Top 10 in any chart, until they released "The Metal", which was shown on Saturday Night Live. In 2006, they starred in, and recorded the soundtrack for, the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. In support of the film, the band went on a world tour, appearing for the first time with a full band. They released their newest album Rize of the Fenix on May 15, 2012.
          <br><br>
          Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Critics have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as "mock rock". Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage in a style that music critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera.
